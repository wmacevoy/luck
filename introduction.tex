\chapter*{Introduction}
\marginnote{These might easily exist, perhaps as another name, in the literature; I just don't know what it is called.}

The point of these notes is to introduce an idea of ``luck'' that connects mathematical probability with the everyday notion.

As a motivating problem, imagine walking along the beach and asking a random person to toss a tennis ball so that it lands in the sand.  The probability that it lands at some point would depend on the habits of the thrower and the details of the beach, but we can summarize this as some probability distribution, $p(x)=\rho(x) dx$, where $x\in\R^2$ is a suitable coordinate system for the beach in question.  It would almost certainly not be a uniform distribution, and it would almost certainly not be particularly concentrated.

Traditional probability feels uncomfortable here.  The chances of the ball landing at a given point is zero\marginnote{For a continuous probablity distribution such as this, the chance of the ball landing in some small area $dx$ near $x$ is $p(x)=\rho(x) dx$.  But the ball lands at a point, so $dx$ is zero, so the probablity $p(x)=\rho(x) dx$ is zero.}, and so miraculous.  Yet anyone watching this process would only occasionaly be surprized by the outcome.

As common (and mundane, not miraculous) such situations are, the language of statistics seems to have difficulty with the notion.  Nor is it limited to continuous cases, just when there are a lot of possible outcomes.  Such examples lead to non-zero but very small probabilities.

To distinguish from the more general notion of luck, note that that there is no extrinsic value on an outcome.  To say something is ``lucky'' often means there is some value (different from the probability) associated with outcomes.  However, outcomes that are the most valuable are often the least probable, and outcomes of equal probability ought to be equally lucky.  This observation leads to the following definition of luck:
\begin{quote}
The luck $L(x)$ of an outcome $x$ is the probability of getting any outcome $y$ that is more probable than $x$, plus one-half the probability of getting any outcome $y$ that is equally probable to $x$.
\end{quote}
From the perspective of discussing luck, it it convenient to have few sets: $\Omega(x)$, the outcomes more likely than $x$, and $\omega(x)$, the outcomes equally likely to $x$.

\begin{definition}{Omega.}  $\Omega(x)$ is set of outcomes more likely than $x$:
\begin{equation}
\Omega(x) = \left\{ y \mid p(y)>p(x) \right\} \,.
\end{equation}
We define $|\Omega(x)|$ as the probability an outcome is in $\Omega(x)$,
$|\Omega(x)| = P(y\in\Omega(x))$.  In the discrete case, this is
\begin{equation}
|\Omega(x)| = \sum_{y \in \Omega(x)} p(y),
\end{equation}
and, in the continuous case,
\begin{equation}
|\Omega(x)| = \int_{\Omega(x)} \rho(y)\,dy \,.
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{omega.}\marginnote{For the tyical case of many outcomes with different probabilities, $|\omega(x)|$ is small.  For example, $|\omega(x)|=0$ for any multivariate normal distribution.}
$\omega(x)$ is the set of outcomes equally likley to $x$:
\begin{equation}
\omega(x) = \left\{ y \mid p(y)=p(x) \right\} \,.
\end{equation}
Similar to $\Omega(x)$, we define $|\omega(x)|$ as the probability an outcome is in $\omega(x)$,
$|\omega(x)| = P(y\in\omega(x))$.  

In the discrete case, this is
\begin{equation}
|\omega(x)| = \sum_{y \in \omega(x)} p(y),
\end{equation}
and, in the continuous case,
\begin{equation}
|\omega(x)| = \int_{\omega(x)} \rho(y)\,dy \,.
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

With these definitions in place, we define luck mathematically as follows:
\begin{definition}{Luck.}  The luck of an outcome is the probability getting any more likely outcome, plus half the probability of getting any equally likely outcome:
\begin{equation}
L(x)=|\Omega(x)| + \frac{1}{2} |\omega(x)| \,.
\end{equation}
\end{definition}


\subsection{Properties of Luck.}
\begin{itemize}
\item $0 \leq L(x) \leq 1$.  This ranges from no luck to perfect luck.
\item If $L(x)$ is close to 1, then $p(x)$ is comparatively small, and most outcomes would have a higher probability (you are lucky).  
\item If $L(x)$ is close to 0, then $p(x)$ is comparatively large, and most outcomes would have a lower probability (you are unlucky).
\item $E(L)=\frac{1}{2}$.  On average, luck is always 50:50.
\end{itemize}

We are interested in cases which have many possible outcomes with low but somewhat different probabilities (like the tennis ball on the beach).  If the space is well divided (so $\max |\omega|=\max_{x}|\omega(x)|$ is small), then there are other interesting properties of luck:\marginnote{In particular $\omega(x)=0$ for the normal, exponential, beta, and gamma distributions.  As a worst-case counterexample, the flattest distribution is the uniform distribution, for which $\omega(x)=1$.}
\begin{itemize}
\item $E(f(L))=\int_0^1 f(L) dL+\varepsilon$, where $|\varepsilon| \leq \max|f''| \cdot \max |\omega|^2 / 12$.
\item For $p>1$, $E(L^p)=1/(p+1)-\varepsilon$, $0 \leq \varepsilon \leq p^2 \max |\omega|^2/12$.
\item For $0 \leq a \leq b \leq 1$, $E(L \in [a,b])=b-a + \varepsilon$, $|\varepsilon| \leq \max |\omega|$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}{Coins.}
Suppose we toss 8 fair coins.  The probability of getting exactly $x$ heads out of 8 tosses is given by the binomial distribution
\begin{equation}
p(x)=\frac{8!}{x!(8-x)!}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^8
\end{equation}
What is the luck associated with this distribution?
\begin{table}
\caption{Table is arranged in increasing luck (which is decreasing probability). Getting exactly $x=4$ heads is unlucky, requiring only $L=14\%$ luck, while getting $x=0$ or $x=8$ heads is almost $100\%$ luck.}
