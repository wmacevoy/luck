# I know "scheme-full" is tempting, but three hours later you may have wished you picked out the packages...
#
# 1. Try using
#
#  tlmgr search --global --file <missing thing>
#
# to figure out what you need to install.
#
# 2. append extra RUN lines so docker can cache your build steps instead of re-running all of them.
#
# 3. Once you have the packages, combine them into one tlmgr install in sorted order to help docker
#    cache them once and make it easier on your collaborators...
#
# 4. You can nullify multiline RUN lines by replacing inserting an 'echo skip' at the begining:
#
#    # enabled
#    RUN tlmgr install \
#        <package1> \
#        <package2>
#
#    # disabled
#    RUN echo skip tlmgr install \
#        <package1> \
#        <package2>
#
#    This format makes it easier to manage a package list in sorted order, which is the
#    recommendation after you figure out all the packages to install through multiple
#    RUN commands.
